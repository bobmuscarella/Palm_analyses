# Palm_analyses
R scripts for comparing local and regional palm-soil associations in the Amazon.
---
This repository is being developed to eventually hold R scripts that will do things like:
1) Characterize species-specific associations with local soil variables in several CTFS plots.
2) Estimate effects of local soil variables on species-specific survival (and perhaps growth/recruitment) in several CTFS plots.
3) Compare the responses generated from (1) and (2) with patterns of occurrence and abundance across a dataset of transects from across the western Amazon.
